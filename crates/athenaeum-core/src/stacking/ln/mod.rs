//! Local normalization (M2, spec §5.2): per-frame `A(x,y)`/`B(x,y)` grids in
//! the reference geometry, applied as `v' = A·v + B`. `grid` holds the grid
//! type itself (`LnGrid`), the bicubic B-spline evaluator that turns the
//! coarse stride grid into per-pixel `A`/`B` values, and the `.athln` binary
//! sidecar one frame's grids (one per channel, `LnFrameGrids`) round-trip
//! through. `background` (M2 Task 2) is the per-plane robust background
//! model on the same stride mesh — the input Task 5 builds `B = B_ref −
//! s·B_tgt` from. `scale` (M2 Task 3) is the frame-global multiplicative
//! term `s` — the RCR location of matched-star PSF-flux ratios — Task 5
//! stamps onto the grid as `A`. `reference` (M2 Task 4) is the per-group
//! low-noise reference (`LnReference`) Task 5 measures background/scale
//! against — built by sharing `stacking::integrate::integrate_planes`, the
//! same per-plane engine loop `integrate_group` (Plan 4) drives. Later M2
//! tasks (application, provenance) build on this foundation.
